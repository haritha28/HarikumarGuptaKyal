\subsection{Location Tracking}
\qquad Data4Help helps TrackMe to use monitor the location of the individual which can be later shared with the third party after validation. This service of location tracking can be helpful in case of emergencies which we come across in automated SOS. We basically use the Global Positioning System or the GPS to track the location of the individual. There are chances that we can lose the GPS connection in certain cases like may be inside our home due to poor connection to satellite. In such cases we can fetch the location from the nearest wi-fi to which our device get connected. In case of an emergency TrackMe system shall locate a minimum of 3 available ambulances that are closest to the emergency location by displaying a map and marking location of the emergency and ambulance nearby, which is would be taking less than a minute to fetch. We then share the data to the nearest ambulance within 5 seconds.We also use location tracking for athletes for a real time visualization of the positions of the athletes for a particular race which is explained further below.
