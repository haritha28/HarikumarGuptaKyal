\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Data4Help API}
\newline \qquad TrackMe extracts location and health of the individual from the API of the   wearable device and stores it in a database. An API of the database is created which is provided to the other services of TrackMe. This information is used for many purposes. “AutomatedSOS” and “Track4Run” uses the API of the “Data4Help” in order to provide their service. Both the services exploit the services of “Data4Help”. “AutomatedSOS” uses the API to monitor the health status of elderly people and help them by providing an ambulance. “Track4Run” uses the API to extract the location and health of individuals registered as athletes. The location will be displayed to all the users and the health status of athletes will be monitored by the third party organizers.
