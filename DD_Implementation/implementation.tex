The implementation of the TrackMe system will be done service by service followed with the integration of all the services. The order in which it is be carried out depends on a number of factors like the complexity of the modules and services, the dependence of other modules on the component being implemented and to the system as a whole, and it should also take into account the possibility of discovering flaws with the proposed design. The later should be dealt in a way that, if such an unfortunate event does happen,the flaws should be found and corrected as soon as possible, to limit the cost of the change of design. 
In this sense, the components of the TrackMe, could be grouped in the following way, with the order specifying the order of implementation: \newline
1. Data4Help Service\newline 2. Automated SOS and Ambulance Application\newline 3. Track4Run\newline 4. TrackMe (Connecting the above three services)
